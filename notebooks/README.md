# /notebooks

This folder contains the two main notebooks for this project:

- **reward_model_training.ipynb** — End-to-end reward model training workflow.
- **post_training.ipynb** — Post-training and additional experiments.  
  [Open in Google Colab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uOFQ_JYa90b6JFT53c9xy7ZP8_n0BoLw/view?usp=sharing)

> **Note:** Due to Colab/Jupyter widget metadata, the post-training notebook may not render directly on GitHub.  
> For best results, download and open in Jupyter locally, or use the Colab link above where available.

**Both notebooks have the outcomes of all cells cached from the latest successful run**, so you can view the results without re-execution.
