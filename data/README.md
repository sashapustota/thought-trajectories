# data/

This directory contains pre-processed trajectories and related intermediate files used for reward model training and analysis.

- **Note:** Raw training data is loaded dynamically (e.g., from external sources or Hugging Face).  
- Files here are typically generated during data farming (see `notebooks/reward_model_training.ipynb`).
