> **Note:** Due to Colab/Jupyter widget metadata, the post-training notebook may not render directly on GitHub. Follow the link above to view it in Google Colab.

**Both notebooks have the outcomes of all cells cached from the latest successful run**, so you can view the results without re-execution.
