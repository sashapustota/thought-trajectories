# models/

This folder is made to contain saved model checkpoints and dimensionality reduction objects:

- `reward_model_math_*.pt`: Trained reward model weights (PyTorch).
- `pca_math_*.pkl`: Fitted PCA transformers (scikit-learn).

Models in this folder are generated by the training pipeline in `notebooks/reward_model_training.ipynb`. 
If you rerun the pipeline, files here may be overwritten.
